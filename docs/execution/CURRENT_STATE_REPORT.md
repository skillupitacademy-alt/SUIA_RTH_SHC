# 📊 Current State Report & Implementation Audit

**Generated**: 2026-01-29 (Post-Revert)
**Scope**: Project Health, Design Fidelity, and Functional Stability.

---

### Phase 1: Restoration Status
- **UI Design**: Successfully reverted to the "Executive White" design (pre-ShadCn).
- **Component Architecture**: Restored legacy high-density components for Tables and Dialogs.
- **Hook Layer**: Re-implemented individual hierarchy hooks (`useDomains`, `useSubjects`, etc.) to match restored components.

### Phase 2: Functional Preservation
- **API Connectivity**: Preserved robust `@quiz/api-client` with environment-authoritative URL resolution.
- **Navigation Safety**: Preserved sanitized `AdminLayout` to prevent 404 errors on dead links.
- **State Integrity**: Preserved fix for React "uncontrolled to controlled" warnings in `CascadingSelect.tsx`.

### Phase 4: UI/UX & Production Hardening
- **Labeling**: Systematically refactored technical jargon (Underscore IDs) into human-friendly titles across all user journeys.
- **Log Hygiene**: 100% Zero-Log policy enforced; all `console.log` statements purged for production security.
- **Data Integrity**: Cascading deletes verified in DB schema to prevent orphan records.

### Phase 5: Administrative Governance Hardening (Batch 23)
- **CRUD Interfaces**: All management tables (Domain...User) hardened with explicit state resets and layman-friendly error messages.
- **Documentation**: Formalized Exam Configuration logic into `docs/pages/exams/EXAM_CONFIGURATION.md`.
- **Structure**: Consolidated exam-related documentation under `docs/pages/exams/` and eliminated redundant folders.

### Phase 6: Cascading Readiness Governance (Batch 24)
- **Engine Stability**:Selection Engine updated with Graceful Degradation (MAX count) and flexible domain-only pool expansion.
- **Hierarchical Health**: Implemented multi-level diagnostics (Domain-to-Subtopic) with 4/4/5 readiness standard.
- **Real-time Governance**: Quiz selection buttons are now strictly disabled for 🔴 Action Required content areas.
- **Admin Visibility**: Added drill-down tree view to Content Readiness Board for granular content gap analysis.

### 🛡️ Reliability & Safety
- **Build Enforcement**: Strict TypeScript/ESLint checks re-enabled (`Exit Code 0` on builds).
- **Runtime Crash Mitigation**: Global `formatTimeAgo` safety utility implemented across all governance tables.
- **Data Parity**: Skills management and UI labels aligned 100% with DB schema and professional UX standards.
- **Strict Linting**: TypeScript and ESLint compliance is 100% enforced in both admin and web apps.
